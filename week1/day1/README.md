# Day 1: Linear Algebra & NumPy Foundation

## What I Learned Today
- Vector operations and their meaning in ML
- NumPy array manipulation and broadcasting
- Cosine similarity calculation
- Basic collaborative filtering algorithm

## Projects Completed
1. **Matrix Operations Library** - Basic building blocks for recommendation systems
2. **Simple Collaborative Filtering** - User-based recommendation algorithm

## Key Insights
- Cosine similarity measures angle between vectors, perfect for user preference comparison
- Sparse matrices are common in recommendation systems
- Collaborative filtering finds similar users to make predictions

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Improve collaborative filtering with matrix factorization
- Add evaluation metrics
- Handle edge cases better
